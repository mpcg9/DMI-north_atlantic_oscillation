all .mat file have the boundaries:
Bounds_lat = [60 80]; % Boundaries for latitude [in degrees]
Bounds_lon = [-80 -20]; % Boundaries for longitude [in degrees]

geopotential converted to unit 'meters' via dividing by gravitational acceleration (see convert_gpm_to_meters.m)

GBI calculated with compute_GBI.m
